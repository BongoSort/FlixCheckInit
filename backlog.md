### Good to know

Create project from console:

java -jar flix.jar init

compile and run project from console:

java -jar flix.jar run

The Flix build system supports the following commands:

* init: creates a new Flix project in the current directory.
* check: checks the current project for compiler errors.
* build: builds the current project (i.e. emits Java bytecode).
* build-jar: builds a jar-file from the current project.
* build-pkg: builds a fpkg-file from the current project.
* run: runs main in current project.
* test: runs all tests in the current project.
